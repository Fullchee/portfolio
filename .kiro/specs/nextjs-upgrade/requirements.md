# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves upgrading the Next.js framework from version 14.1.0 to the latest version 15.5.3. This is a major version upgrade that requires careful handling of breaking changes, dependency updates, and ensuring all existing functionality continues to work properly. The upgrade will improve performance, security, and provide access to new Next.js features while maintaining the current portfolio website functionality.

2. WHEN navigation occurs THEN routing SHALL work as expected
3. WHEN SEO components are rendered THEN they SHALL generate proper meta tags
4. WHEN the application is tested THEN all TypeScript compilation SHALL pass
5. WHEN linting is run THEN there SHALL be no new ESLint errors related to the upgrade

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to update the development and build scripts, so that they work with the new Next.js version.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running `npm run dev` THEN the development server SHALL start successfully
2. WHEN running `npm run build` THEN the application SHALL build without errors
3. WHEN running `npm run start` THEN the production server SHALL start successfully
4. WHEN running `npm run lint` THEN linting SHALL complete without upgrade-related errors
