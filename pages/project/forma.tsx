          <strong>Building Dashboards</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          I build modern incentive compensation dashboards and core components
          to help sales people understand how they're getting paid.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the frontend, I use TypeScript and JavaScript with React. Some
          libraries that I've used are
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <a href="https://react-select.com">React Select</a>
          </li>
          <li>
            <a href="https://recharts.org/">Recharts</a>
          </li>
          <li>
            <a href="https://redux.js.org/">Redux</a>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>To test the frontend, we use Jest and React Testing Library</p>

        <p>For styling, we use SASS</p>

        <p>
          I also started an article club and heavily contributed to TIL channels

          <strong>Taking ownership of our Storybook instance</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Our team was growing really quickly and we needed a way to communicate
          and document our components. I took initiative to update Storybook and
          add our components.
        </p>
        <p>
          We also wanted a way to work more closely with the design team. So I
          integrated Figma iframes into Storybook.
