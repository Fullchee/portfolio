      <h2>Why</h2>
      <p>
        My family got a high water bill from a leaking toilet. This project will
        prevent that from happening again. I also hope to share it with others
        so that they don't get high water bills.

      {/* What are the major features that make it unique? How does it compare to existing
products like it?  */}

      <h2>Tech stack</h2>
      {/* What did you start with? Was this built from scratch? Did you have a team? If so,
which parts did you do? Where did the design come from? Was there any
collaboration?  */}
      <p>Back-end: I want to refine my fundamentals so I used Node.js, </p>

      <p>Front-end: I used React (create-react-app)</p>

      <h2>Challenges</h2>
