      <h2>Why</h2>
      <p>
        This project was inspired when my sister was working part-time at a
        supermarket and at a hospital. She would get her schedule every other
        week and she mentioned how annoying it was to add her shifts to Google
        Calendar because her schedule would be different every week.
      </p>
      <p>
        My aim of this project was enable my sister to batch create calendar
        events within 30 seconds.
      </p>
      {/* What did you start with? Was this built from scratch? Did you have a team? If so,
which parts did you do? Where did the design come from? Was there any
collaboration?  */}
      <h2>Thought process</h2>
      {/* What was the hardest part of building this product? Where did you get stuck along the
way?  */}
      {/* When you did get stuck, how did you resolve it? How did you overcome the obstacles
you faced?  */}

        The biggest challenge was integrating with Google Calendar and getting
        the appropriate connection. Despite that, a lot of the magic is already
        done for you.

        This was my first time using CSS Grid (which I learned from{" "}
        <a href="https://cssgrid.io/">Wes Bos' free CSS Grid course</a> that I
        really like) and this form was good practice.
      </p>
      <h2>Next steps</h2>
      <p>
        I have a rather complicated UI for creating shifts. I can simplify it I
        had it set to my sister's hospital shifts by default (day, evening and
        night shifts). Then, for power users, I have an option to create default
        shifts and keep the modal.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once it's more polished up, I can post it on a few subreddits and see
        how the reception is. It would be nice to help people. As a caveat
        though, I would have to learn more about Google Cloud pricing and how it
        works.
