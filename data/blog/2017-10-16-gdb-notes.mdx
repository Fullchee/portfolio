I wrote these notes when debugging my router for my networking course (CSC458)

Yashar Ganjali is a great prof

This was moved over from my notes repo because having it on my blog makes it more searchable

### Get GDB to look like an IDE debugger

- GDB Text User Interface
- Ctrl-x-a
- or type `tui`

### How to refresh the display?

- ctrl l

### Scroll through previous commands?

- `ctrl-p`: back
- `ctrl-n`: forwards
- not arrow keys anymore!
- `Ctrl-b`: back
- `Ctrl-f`: forward

### Python in GDB?

- type `python`
- and then a new prompt will appear
- type end to end the python

#### Example of usefulness of Python in GDB?

`python print (gdb.breakpoints()[0].location) -> cars.c:car_arrive`

### After a seg fault, what do you do to find more info?

- `bt`
  - stands for backtrace, looks at the stack trace

### Run a command automatically at a given breakpoint

1. command 1
2. run
3. end

- this will execute run on breakpoint 1
  - (could have multiple commands!)
- Enable Reverse debugging ???????? command 2
- breakpoint for main record continue end
- command 3
- the run end

### Create a watchpoint

- watch
- reverse-continue

### Print all of the local variable info

`info locals`

### 2 ways to add arguments to an executable

#### Option 1

```bash
gdb --args ./traffic schedule.txt
gdb --args ./executable -arg1 -arg2
```

- the args have to go in front of everything

#### Option 2

```
gdb ./file
in GDB: run arg1 arg2 ...
```

### How to temporarily remove your breakpoints?

`disable`

### How to print a char array as a string?

`instead of print char_arr x/s char_arr`
