For 2021 I decided to redesign and revamp my site with the following goals in mind:

1. Implement design ideas from [Refactoring UI](https://refactoringui.com/)
2. Include a blog with MDX
3. Try out [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)

## Design

I wanted to create a site with a minimalistic and accessible design that offers a pleasant reading experience. I went with [Inter](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter) as the primary font and [Zilla Slab](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Zilla+Slab) for the headings. Both are legible and work very well together. When it came to the colors, I wanted something soft for the eye. Green has always been my favorite color, so I decided to use it and complement it with cool grays.

When it came to the layout, I chose to use [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). I've been writing CSS for many years and in many forms; [BEM](http://getbem.com/), [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/), [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/) - you name it. But I always found it hard to maintain it.

Since I started using Tailwind a year ago, I haven't looked back. There are many reasons behind this decision (this deserves its own post), but for now, I'll leave [an article](https://adamwathan.me/css-utility-classes-and-separation-of-concerns/) its creator wrote a few years ago where he explains why the "best practices" are not so good.

## Blog & Content Management

There are numerous blog engines ready to be used, but I decided to develop my solution with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) (and [it's all open source!](https://github.com/fullchee/portfolio) âœ¨). I'm a big believer in not reinventing the wheel, but I wanted to take this chance to learn a new technology, in this case, MDX. Markdown is quite easy to use, plus giving me the ability to use JSX components down the road to enrich blog posts.

I write each post in its own `.mdx` file. It is a straightforward process with no friction to create new articles. These files also contain a [Front Matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/) block containing metadata (title, summary, etc.), it is used to display information in multiple places of the site and for SEO (`<meta>` tags). All .mdx files are processed at build time, generating static pages.

## Fast loading âš¡

I use [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) to host the site, and since all pages are static, they get deployed to their edge network. This ensures blazing fast loading times. Next.js and Vercel give me one of the easiest ways to develop and ship production-ready applications to the web.

All this has allowed me to get a perfect score in [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse). Web Vitals are becoming an important metric, back in May Google announced that page experience signals would be included in Google Search ranking.

## Summary

I'm happy with the result. I plan on keep updating the site to add new functionalities but I wanted to get out a working version of the site as soon as possible. This is the result ðŸ˜„.
