For 2021 I decided to redesign and revamp my site with the following goals in mind:

1. Implement design ideas from [Refactoring UI](https://refactoringui.com/)
2. Include a blog with MDX
3. Try out [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
   - and see what all the hype is about

## Design
- hugely inspired by
   - Josh W. Comeau's ebook on developing a portfolio
   - juliacodes.com

### Fonts

- `Comfortaa` for super large text like the "Hello" to stand out
- `Major Mono Display` for headlines
  - I wanted a mono font to make it more "programmy"
- [`Inter`](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter) as the text font


Hosted on Vercel
- all the pages are static so it gets deployed to the CDN/edge network
