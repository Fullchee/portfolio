## How do I block Reddit?

### On my laptop
I want to be deliberate on how I spend my time.

I can get distracted for hours, especially on r/aww/ üê∞üê±üê∂.

However, reddit is also the source of useful information, with Quora and Reddit taking over Yahoo Answers as the internet's go-to place for life's questions. (eg: plumbing questions)

This is how I'm using Reddit for my benefit and not just for Reddit's benefit.


**Software**
* [Freedom](https://freedom.to/) to block specific sites across devices, including Reddit
* I also have a Chrome/Firefox extension called LeechBlock for redundancy purposes


### On my phone

**Software**

* Firefox for Android
    * Leechblock to block Reddit
* Freedom app
    * When a Freedom session is active, I disable the use of Settings
* Nova Launcher
    * I have it setup so that when I tap and hold on an app, there isn't an option to uninstall.
    * This is to prevent me from uninstalling Freedom.


## How do I use Reddit if it's blocked?

I do not allow any access to Reddit on my phone.

On my laptop, I

1. Run `wget <reddit-url>`
2. I might have to rename the file to have an `.html` extension.

### How do I view more comments?

When I run the `wget` command, I replace the `www` with `old` to download the old reddit version of the site.


### What if I want to ask a question?
1. Turn off Freedom
2. Run `sleep 3600 && open -a Freedom` to turn on Freedom back in an hour
3. Go on Reddit and use it normally.

### How do I view videos

1. I download the new reddit URL with `wget`
2. I open the page with my web browser.
    * Reddit has some JS that hides
3. I open the dev tools (right click anywhere, click `Inspect` )
4. Press `cmd` `shift` `p` and type `Disable JavaScript`
5. Press enter
    * the sources tab should have a yellow warning icon beside it now
    * ![sources tab header with a yellow warning triangle](/assets/images/blog/sources-tab.png)
6. Refresh the page
7. Look at the elements tab
8. Find the `<video>` tag and look for the `<source>` tag inside it
9. Copy the `<source>` tag's `src` attribute
10. Open VLC
11. In the Menu Bar > File > Open Network
12. Paste the URL

This approach works for me because it can't scale and I can't endlessly scroll. The friction prevents me from going on reddit.com and going to the home page and endlessly scrolling.

This is the reasoning behind my https://fullchee-reminders.netlify.app/ app where there are no links to other podcasts or YouTube videos and there isn't an infinite scroll.
