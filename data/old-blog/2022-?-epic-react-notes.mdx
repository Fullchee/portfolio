## Advanced React Patterns

### Context Module Pattern

- when creating a `Context` + `useReducer`
- if you have common dispatches you want to share
  - just export it from the `counter.js` alongside the `CountProvider` and `useCount`

```js
export { UserProvider, useUser, updateUser };
```

#### Why can't we just put the function in the `useCount` accessor?

- we'd have to add `useCallback` to each function because we'd be putting it in the Provider's `value`
- won't be able to tree shake (only get the functions we use)
  - every function would have a `useCallback` because they'd need to be in the dependency array
- can't lazy load

### Compound components

- like `Table` and `Column`
- where `Column` expects a bunch of props from `Table`
  - but we don't set it explicitly

```js
<Table>
  {/* `Table` gives `Column` some props behind the scenes */}
  <Column />
  <Column />
  <Column />
</Table>
```

#### Why do we need to `cloneElement`?

- state is handled by the parent component
- we need to clone because we can't modify props directly
  - like creating a new copy of array
- we only want to use `cloneElement` on react components
- Flexible Compound Components uses `Context` so that it can pass to any descendant
  - so we don't need `cloneElement`

#### How do you know if a component is React or a vanilla DOM element?

```
typeof child.type === 'string' // DOM
```

#### Flexible Compound Components

- instead of passing props via `cloneElement`
- we pass down data via `Context` and `useContext`

### Prop Collections & Getters

Why

- less duplication
  - get the shared props
- example of props to be returned `{'aria-pressed': on, onClick: toggle}`

```js
function useToggle() {
  const [on, setOn] = React.useState(false);
  const toggle = () => setOn(!on);

  function getTogglerProps({ onClick, ...props } = {}) {
    return {
      "aria-pressed": on,
      onClick: callAll(onClick, toggle),
      ...props,
    };
  }

  return {
    on,
    toggle,
    getTogglerProps,
  };
}
```

**Usage**

```js
<Switch {...getTogglerProps({on})} />
<button
  {...getTogglerProps({
    'aria-label': 'custom-button',
    onClick: () => console.info('onButtonClick'),
    id: 'custom-button-id',
  })}
>
```

### State Reducer

- let the user of the hook pass in their own reducer
  - inversion of control!
- to avoid duplication, we can do this to just update one case

```js
function toggleStateReducer(state, action) {
  if (action.type === "toggle" && clickedTooMuch) {
    return { on: state.on };
  }
  return toggleReducer(state, action); // default hook reducer
}
```

#### Why is it called State reducer?

- you pass in a reducer that modifies the state

#### What does the `={}` do?

```js
// useToggle() will work
function useToggle({initialOn = false} = {}) {...}
```

vs

```js
// useToggle() will result in an error
function useToggle({initialOn = false}) {
```

### Control Props

- ![Control Props](/assets/images/blog/sources-tab.png)
- replicating what React does to forms (controlled vs uncontrolled)
  - is there a value that tha sh
- error when going from uncontrolled to controlled (or vice versa)
  - example: giving React a value and then later assigning it

```js
const on = isControlled ? controlledOn : state.on;

function dispatchWithOnChange(action) {
  if (!isControlled) {
    dispatch(action); // update the redux's state
  }
  const newState = reducer({ ...state, on }, action);
  onChange?.(newState, action);
}
```

#### When to warn?

1. Passing `on` without `onChange`
2. Passing a value for `on` and later passing `undefined` or `null`
3. Passing `undefined` or `null` for `on` and later passing a value

console.logs always need to be in a `useEffect`

side effect to check if value is undefined or null

- `readOnly` prop
- setting the initial value of `isChange`
- you can put hooks in the if statement because process.env.NODE_ENV never changes

```js
if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== "production") {
  useWarning();
}
```
