# portfolio

This portfolio was made with

- the Next.js [blog-starter](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/blog-starter) template
- Tailwind CSS 2
- TypeScript
- MDX

The design is heavily inspired by

- Josh Comeau's [Building an Effective Dev Portfolio](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/effective-portfolio/)
- juliacodes.com

## TODOs

- Project pages
  - Update resume links to each project folder
  - resume: have multiple resumes, for each type of role
- ensure that each project page has it's own preview image (og)
- Blog: remove duplicate enumeration (for ordered lists)

- reread Refactoring UI

    - https://craig-roush-portfolio-template.webflow.io/
    - Wes bos css grid
    - footer with geo shapes https://portfolio.smakosh.com/
