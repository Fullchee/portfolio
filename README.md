#### What I'm trying to convey

- Competence
  - Has this person built professional-looking projects before?
- Enthusiasm
  - Does this person seem eager to learn
  - excited for the kinds of work they would do on the job?
- Fit
  - Does this person have the right kind of personality for the company?
  - Have they worked with the languages and frameworks we use here?

#### Too complex but nice to have

- Dark mode with animation of the sun setting and the moon rising
